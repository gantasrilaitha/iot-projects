Weather Monitoring System,IOT: used dht11(temperature sensor) ,bmp180(pressure sensor) , rain sensor and air quality sensor with nodemcu-8266 microcontroller to achieve a highly localised weather information. Obtained sensor values are captured on thingspeak and alert the user if raining by a buzzer.

Water Level Monitoring : used water level sensor, aurduino, ,led bulbs, motors to measure the water level in the soil ang alert the farmers if water goes below a threshold and sprinklers run automatically to water the field

Digital Thyroid Band: Predict thyroid levels using a wearable, with nodemcu-8266, temperature sensor(dht22), pulse-oximeter
and sound sensor. All the sensor values are captured in firebase and shown in an app using Android Studio. ML model needs to be levarged to predict the thyroid levels-hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism or normal
